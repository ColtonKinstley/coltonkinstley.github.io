In mathematical writing a corollary is a result that follows easily from a larger theorem. In particular this result would not be seen as major or difficult but would rather be considered a natural application of the previous theorem. I named this blog Corollaries because that is precisely what I hope to catalog here; neat and short tidbits of mathematics, corollaries.

### Who is this blog for?

I intend to avoid formal proofs in this blog so that anyone with an interest in mathematics can follow the arguments. At some stage during a math degree one is taught how to read and write proofs, a powerful tool of logic, but this is specialized skill not possessed by everyone. It is my hope that an engineer or computer programmer would find the articles here understandable and entertaining.

### What to expect.

There are so many beautiful and surprising results in mathematics that are locked away in textbooks and papers that use so many specialized words and symbols that, even though many people may be interested, only specialists have a hope of understanding these works. I hope to explain in plain language some of my favorite ideas and problems.
