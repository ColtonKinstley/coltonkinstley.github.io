This article is about those games where a picture is placed on tiles and scrambled. 
Imagine it's your birthday and you tear into a present to find inside a sliding puzzle.
### Have you ever been tempted to cheat?

After failing to solve this puzzle in a few minutes you may be tempted to cheat. It's not too hard to strip the tiles off and replace them in the correct order. Incidently, a similar technique is often used to return a Rubik's cube to it's original configuration. But, let's say that half way through this dishonest process you have a change of heart, realize life is about the journey and resolve to finish this puzzle the way it was intended no matter how long it takes. So you put the pieces back as randomly as you can, steel yourself and resume your efforts. However, as the hours turn to days and the days turn to months you begin to suspect something is amiss about this puzzle. Perhaps the puzzle was an elaborate joke and isn't solvable at all? Or, maybe something sinister happened when you replaced the pieces on that fateful day.

In fact something almost certainly did happen, something you may not have considered possible. It's pretty likely that you put the tiles back into the board in a position that is unsolvable. How likely you ask? Well, let's find out.
